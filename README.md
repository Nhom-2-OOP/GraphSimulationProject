# GRAPH SIMULATION USING JAVAFX

![Demo](sample.png)
This is a second year OOP Lab project. Visualizes the following algorithms on graphs input by the user on an interactive canvas.

## Installation

Run nhom2.window.Main by using Java IDE.

```bash
Main.java
```

## Usage :

### Vertex Placement Mode:
1. Placement randomly
2. Placement circularly
3. Placement using force-directed algorithm in real-time


### Feature and Algorithm Available
1. Path Finding
2. Auto Path Finding
3. Traversal Graph ( BFS and DFS Algorithm)
4. Shortest Path ( Dijkstra Algorithm)
5. Minimum Spanning Tree ( Kruskal Algorithm)
6. Coloring Graph ( Greedy Algorithm )
